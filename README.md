<h1>Amazon Prime Login Page Clone</h1>
<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p>In this project, I made a copy of the Amazon Prime login page using basic web development skills. I used only HTML and CSS to create a page that looks very similar to the original Amazon Prime login page.</p>

<h3>Tools Used</h3>
<p>Here are the tools I used for this project:</p>
<ul>
    <li>HTML: For making the structure of the webpage, like where things go and what they look like.</li>
    <li>CSS: For adding styles to the page, like colors and fonts, to make it look like the Amazon Prime page.</li>
</ul>
